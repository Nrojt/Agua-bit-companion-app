## GUIDE:

PREPARING THE AGUA:BIT FOR (FIRST) USE
After unpacking your Agua:Bit and installing the latest release, plug the Agua:Bit into your computer, open the application and go to the Update screen (on first startup the menu should be hidden, click on the three dots in the upper-left corner to reveal the menu). If this is your first time, make sure you are connected to the internet and press the “Update” or “Download”  button. The required file for the Agua:Bit will be downloaded to your documents folder. When the download is complete, press the 'Update' button again to transfer the file to the Agua:Bit. The Agua:Bit can now be used.

Plug the required sensors into the slots on the Agua:Bit and make sure they are firmly seated. When connecting the sensors, be careful, too much pressure can break the sensor or the connector on the Agua:Bit.

## YOUR FIRST MEASUREMENT
Select the sensors you connected to the Agua:Bit from the connect tab. Make sure to select the correct slots and the corresponding options. The slot numbers are ordered from left to right. After your selection, press the “Send to Agua:Bit” button and wait until the confirmation message appears.

Put the sensors into the water, for more information about the correct use of each sensor see our website, but make sure the Agua:Bit and its connection points stays dry. To make a measurement, go to the Measure tab and click “Measure”. The measured values will now appear on the screen. To get additional information about the measured values, click on the measurement indications.

## SAVING OPENING AND DELETING YOUR MEASUREMENT
After taking a measurement, press the “Save” button to save your measurement. Give it a name, and if you want to, add the location and date of the measurement. Press “Save” again to save your measurement.

To open your saved measurement(s), click on the “Open measurement” button. All locally saved measurements will appear on the left, and all measurements saved in our database will appear on the right. Select a measurement and click on the corresponding “Open” button to open the measurement. The measurement will now appear.

To delete a saved measurement, click on it and press the delete button. It is possible to delete multiple measurements at a time, by selecting multiple measurements by pressing the control button and the left mouse button to select multiple measurements. A popup window will appear asking you to confirm the deletion of your measurement. After confirming, the deletion is final and cannot be reversed.

Take note: to save measurements in our database, a free account is required.

## COMPARING MEASUREMENTS
In the open measurements screen, select two measurements by pressing the control button and the left mouse button simultaneously on the measurements. To deselect a measurement, press the control button and the left mouse button once again. A new screen will appear with the two selected measurements. To get additional information about the measured values, click on the measurement indications. To go back to the compare measurements screen, click on the back button.

## LOG IN OR CREATE AN ACCOUNT
